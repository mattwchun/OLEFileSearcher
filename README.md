# OLEFileSearcher

OLEFileSearcher searches Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Compound Files (CF).

There are 2 ways to use this OLE File Searcher
1) 'python Main.py relative_path_to_file search_term'. This is the quickest. Allows user to search for a term in a specific file.
2) 'python Main.py' which will allow you to search multiple files and search terms with one program excecution

Requires the following modules (Until I add a setup.py for distutils):
1) olefile
2) binascii
